## Overview
This script automates the initial setup of an Ubuntu server (VPS) by performing essential tasks such as updating the system, installing necessary packages, and configuring a basic firewall. It is designed to be fetched and executed directly from GitHub for quick and easy deployment.

## Features
- **System Update**: Ensures your system is up-to-date with the latest packages.
- **Essential Packages Installation**: Installs commonly required packages for server management.
- **UFW Configuration**: Sets up a basic firewall to allow OpenSSH and enhance server security.
